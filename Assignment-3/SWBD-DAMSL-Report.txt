Assignment 3 Report

Name: Suraj Rajasekhar

1. If you included files other than baseline_crf.py, advanced_crf.py, evaluate_model.py, and hw3_corpus_tool.py, or modified hw3_corpus_tool.py please describe what the files do and/or your modifications to hw3_corpus_tool.py.

No

2. Describe how you evaluated your baseline and advanced features

Manually selected the random 75% of labeled data as Training set and remaining 25% files as testing set. 
Trained the model based on the features constructed as given in the assignment. For evaluation, we are using accuracies as the measure.

For baseline features, all the 4 features are constructed as given in the assignment.
For advanced, several different features are constructed as explained below.

I also evaluated my model using k fold cros validation and evaluated the accuracy by dividing the correctly predicted act_tags with the total number of act_tags . 

3. Describe your advanced feature set.

Use of Bigrams on every token & POS tag of utterance - a pair of consecutive written units such as letters, syllables, or words
Removal of Stop words {'a-','the-','an-','in-','to-','a','the','an','in','to',',','.'}
a feature for whether or not the speaker has changed in comparison with the previous utterance
a feature marking the first utterance of the dialogue.
a feature for every token in the utterance
a feature for every part of speech tag in the utterance

4. If you tried alternate advanced feature sets, please describe them.
I tried different approaches. My Advance feature set includes baseline features plus one of the below.
a. removal of stop words
b. Use of Bigrams on tokens and POS tags
c. use of Trigrams on tokens and POS tags
d. use of Stop words + bigrams
e. Use of stop words + trigrams

But accuracies were better when used with stopwords + bigrams on tokens and POS tags

5. Accuracy of baseline features was: 71.16
6. Accuracy of advanced features was: 73.85
